## Arrays

An **array** is a data structure that represents a collection of elements of the same data type stored in
contiguous memory locations, allowing constant-time access by index.

---

### Common Operations

- **Traversal:** Accessing each element in the array sequentially.
- **Insertion:** Adding a new element at a specific position (may require shifting elements).
- **Deletion:** Removing an element from a specific position (may require shifting elements).
- **Search:** Finding the index of a specific element (linear or binary search, depending on the context).
- **Access by Index:** Retrieving an element directly using its index.
- **Update by Index:** Modifying an element directly using its index.
